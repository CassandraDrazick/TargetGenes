# TargetGenes
This code was my final assignment within my MBINF program.  Here I have used python to take raw rnaSeq data and utilize machine learning methods along with PCA to identify lists of genes that may be targeted by the Wnt signaling pathway weighted by importance.  This code can be utilized with any rnaSeq data that has been cleaned and normalized for any purpose.  

The .py files involve the code for creating the top gene lists, and the .R files involve the code for cleaning my data.  Data used for this was garnered from publically available data from the following studies:
